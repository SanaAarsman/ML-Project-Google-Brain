Medical tests research.


MaxHR: 

* The maximum heart rate achieved, this test is usually done involving a monitored and graded exercise test (treadmill or bicycle) 
 and can cost from 100$ to 300$ in the US.


Exercise Angina:

* An Exercise Angina test, commonly known as an exercise stress test or treadmill test, evaluates how well the heart 
 handles stress by monitoring its electrical activity and blood pressure while the patient walks on a treadmill or rides 
 a stationary bike. The test is designed to bring on symptoms of angina in a controlled setting to diagnose coronary artery disease.

* The test stops when you reach your target heart rate, are too tired, or if you develop significant symptoms like chest pain, 
 abnormal heart rhythm, or concerning blood pressure changes.

* Can cost from 175$ to 5 000$ in the US, depends on:

    * Standard exercise test (175$ to 400$);
    * Stress Echocardiogram (1 000$ to 3 500$);
    * Nuclear Stress Test (600$ to 5 000$).


OldPeak:

* An "Oldpeak" test is not a standalone diagnostic procedure, but rather a key measurement derived from an 
 Exercise Treadmill Test (ETT), also known as a Stress Test. Oldpeak refers specifically to the amount of ST 
 segment depression (a marker on an electrocardiogram) induced by exercise, comparing it to the level at rest.
 A higher numerical value for oldpeak suggests a greater risk of heart disease, specifically myocardial ischemia, 
 as it indicates a reduced blood supply to the heart during exertion.

* Can cost from 25 000$ to 60 000$ in the US.

ST Slope:

* The test is performed in a clinical setting using a treadmill or bicycle ergometer, 
 often adhering to the Bruce protocol (gradual increases in speed and gradient).

* The patient exercises until they reach maximum effort, exhaustion, develop symptoms (e.g., chest pain),
  or reach a target heart rate.

* Typical price range in US: 200$ to 1 500$.


Notes: Prices always depends on country wise and facility wise.
